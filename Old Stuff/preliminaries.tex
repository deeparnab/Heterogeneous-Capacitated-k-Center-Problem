\section{Preliminaries}
\paragraph{$\opt$-induced Graph.}
Throughout the paper, we work with a guess of $\opt$; given this guess we construct the graph $G_\opt$ or simply $G$ 
by connecting $i\in F$ and $j\in C$ iff $d(i,j)\leq \opt$. In the final solution we return, we hope to connect clients to facilities within
distance $\alpha$ in $G$. This would imply a $\alpha$-approximation for the \mckc problem.
