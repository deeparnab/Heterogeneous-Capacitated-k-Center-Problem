\begin{abstract}
	In this paper we initiate the study of the {\em heterogeneous capacitated $k$-center problem}: given a metric space $X = (F \cup C, d)$, and a collection of facilities $1, 2, \ldots, k$, with facility $i$ having a capacity of $c_i$. The goal is to open each facility $i$ facility at a location ${\rm loc}(i) \in F$, and also to assign clients to facilities using a map $\phi: C \rightarrow [k]$ so that the number of clients assigned to facility $i$ is at most $c_i$, and the objective is to minimize the maximum distance between a client and the location of its assigned facility, i.e., $\max_{c \in C} d(c,{\rm loc}(\phi(c)))$. If all the capacities $c_i$'s are identical, the problem is identical to the well-studied {\em uniform capacitated $k$-center problem} for which constant-factor approximations are known~\cite{XYZ}.
%However, the non-uniform generalization (called the {\em non-uniform capacitated $k$-center problem}) of this problem which has received much attention recently differs from our problem in the following sense: in the non-uniform problem, each facility location $f$ has a fixed capacity $c_f$, and the goal is to open $k$ centers and assign clients so that the capacity constraints are satisfied. On the other hand, in our {\em heterogeneous} problem, a set of $k$ different capacities is specified, and the goal is to suitably place them in facility locations.
The additional choice of determining which capacity should be installed in which location makes our problem technically substantially different from this problem, as well as the {\em non-uniform capacitated $k$-center problem} which has received much attention recently. In fact, one of our contributions is in relating the heterogeneous problem to a special-case of the classical {\em santa-claus problem}. Using this connection, we get the following results for heterogeneous capacitated $k$-center problem.
\begin{oneLiners}
\item A quasi-polynomial time $O(\log n/\epsilon)$-approximation where every capacity is violated by a factor of $O(1+\epsilon)$.
\item A polynomial time $O(1)$-approximation where every capacity is violated by an $O(\log n)$ factor.
\end{oneLiners}
We get improved results for the {\em soft-capacities} version where we can place multiple facilities in the same location, i.e., ${\rm loc}(\cdot)$ need not be injective.

\section{Integrality Gap for Non-Uniform Santa Claus Problem}\label{sec:app-bsig}
We reproduce the integrality gap example for the configuration LP by Bansal and Sviridenko~\cite{BansalS06} for the general max-min allocation problem, and point out how their instance is in fact a $Q|restr|C_{min}$ instance.
Fix integer $K$. There are $K$ machines with demand $D_i = K$; these are the large machines $L = \{M_1,M_2,\ldots,M_K\}$. There are $K-1$ large jobs with $c_j = K$ which can only be assigned to the machines in $L$.
Let $J_B$ be the set of large jobs. There are $K^2$ small machines each with $D_i = 1$; these machines are distributed in $K$ classes where the $i$th class $\cC_i$ contains $K$ small machines. We let $m^{(i)}_k$ denote the $k$th machine in $\cC_i$, for $1\leq k\leq K$.
There are $K^2 + K$ small jobs with $c_j = 1$. These jobs are partitoned into $K$ classes with $i$th class $\cJ_i$ containing $K+1$ small jobs. Each class $\cJ_i$ has one ``public'' job $j^{(i)}_0$ which can be assigned to any machine $m^{(i)}_k \in \cC_i$
 and $K$ ``private'' jobs $j^{(i)}_k$, $1\leq k\leq K$ where $j^{(i)}_k$ can be assigned to only $m^{(i)}_k \in \cC_i$. Furthermore all the private jobs $j^{(i)}_k\in \cJ_i$ can be assigned to the large machine $M_i \in L$. This completes the description of the instance.
Note that the number of machines and jobs are $\Theta(K^2)$.

The integral optimum solution must give one machine $i$ capacity $\leq D_i/K$. Indeed, at least one large machine $M_i$ will not receive a job in $J_B$.
The only other jobs available to $M_i$ are the private jobs in $\calJ_i$. Suppose we allocate two such jobs to $M_i$; wlog these are $j^{(i)}_1$ and $j^{(i)}_2$. Now note
that the machines $m^{(i)}_1$ and $m^{(i)}_2$ have only job $j^{(i)}_0$ which can be assigned to them; and so one of them would get capacity $0$.
Therefore, the machine $M_i$ can receive only one job $j^{(i)}_k$ giving it total capacity $\leq D_i/K$.

On the other hand the configuration LP is feasible. Every large machine $M_i$ gets $z(M_i, j) = 1/K$ for all large jobs $j\in J_B$ and $z(M_i,\{j^{(i)}_1,\ldots, j^{(i)}_K\}) = 1/K$ for the set of private jobs in $\cJ_i$.
For all $1\leq i,k\leq K$, every machine $m^{(i)}_k$ receives $z(m^{(i)}_k,j^{(i)}_k) = 1-1/K$ and $z(m^{(i)}_k,j^{(i)}_0) = 1/K$. One can check all the jobs are fractionally assigned exactly.
