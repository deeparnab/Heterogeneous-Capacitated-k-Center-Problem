\section{Preliminaries: LP Relaxations and Supply Polyhedra}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Re-state natural LP for \mckc.
	\item Definition of Supply Polyhedra.
	\item Technical Conditions -- running sums and separation oracle.
	\item Supply Polyhedra for $Q||C_{min}$.
	\item Supply Polyhedra for $Q|f_i|C_{min}$.
	\item No $(1+\epsilon)$-supply polyhedra possible.
	\item Connection to Integrality Gaps ... how $\alpha$-appx supply polyhedra imply $\alpha$-approximation.
	\item Rounding Assignment  for Small Jobs.
